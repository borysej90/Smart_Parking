## Repository organization

### How to work with branches and code here?

1. *The most important:* Do the `git pull` before you start any work.
2. If you are working on some feature (page, component, etc.) - create your own branch: `git checkout -b <your-identifier>/<issue-id>-<branch-name>`, e.g. `git checkout -b borysei/123-my-branch`
3. Commit your changes regurarly.
4. After you're done, push the changes with `git push`
5. Create **merge request** to `master` branch.

*This part is under construction.*
